Mathematics requires consistent rules and definitions to reach valid conclusions. When the problem states that 'Xylos's mathematical system might differ from ours,' it implies that the fundamental properties of divisors and arithmetic operations could be altered in unpredictable ways, making it impossible to determine a definitive answer within our standard mathematical framework.",
