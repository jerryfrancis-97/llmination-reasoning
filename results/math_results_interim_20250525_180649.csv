Okay, I have this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: ""The proper divisors of \(1.2 \times 10^{12}\) are numerous. A proper divisor of an integer \(N\) is a positive divisor of \(N\) that is less than \(N\). What is the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of \(2.84 \times 10^{15}\)?""

Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down. First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of \(2.84 \times 10^{15}\). Then, once I have that sum, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of thatWait, but the first part mentions \(1.2 \times 10^{12}\), but the question is about \(2.84 \times 10^{15}\). Maybe that's just an example or context, but the actual problem is about \(2.84 \times 10^{15}\). I can focus on that.

First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of \(2.84 \times 10^{15}\). Then, take that sum and find the sum of its proper divisors.

I remember that the sum of divisors function, often denoted as \(\sigma(n)\), gives the sum of all positive divisors of \(n\), including \(n\) itself. But since we're dealing with proper divisors, which exclude \(n\), the sum of proper divisors would be \(\sigma(n) - n\).

for a number \(N\), the sum of its proper divisors is \(\sigma(N) - N\).

the problem is asking for \(\sigma(\sigma(N) - N) - (\sigma(N) - N)\), where \(N = 2.84 \times 10^{15}\).

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The sum of the proper divisors of \(N\) is \(S = \sigma(N) - N\). Then, we need the sum of the proper divisors of \(S\), which would be \(\sigma(S) - S\). the \(\sigma(S) - S\), where \(S = \sigma(N) - N\).

first, I need to compute \(S = \sigma(N) - N\), then compute \(\sigma(S) - S\).

But to compute \(\sigma(N)\), I need the prime factorization of \(N\), because \(\sigma\) is multiplicative and can be computed from the prime factors.

let's start by factoring \(N = 2.84 \times 10^{15}\).

First, express \(2.84 \times 10^{15}\) as an integer. \(10^{15}\) is \(10^{3 \times 5}\), which is \( (2 \times 5)^{15} = 2^{15} \times 5^{15}\). But \(2.84\) is a decimal. Let me convert \(2.84 \times 10^{15}\) into an integer.

Wait, \(2.84 \times 10^{15}\) is equal to \(284 \times 10^{13}\), because moving the decimal two places to the right gives 284, and reducing the exponent by 2 gives \(10^{13}\).

\(N = 284 \times 10^{13}\).

Now, let's factor 284. 284 divided by 2 is 142, then divided by 2 again is 71. 71 is a prime number. factors into \(2^2 \times 71^1\).

\(N = 284 \times 10^{13} = (2^2 \times 71) \times (2^{13} \times 5^{13})\).

Wait, no. \(10^{13}\) is \(2^{13} \times 5^{13}\), when we multiply by 284, which is \(2^2 \times 71\), the entire \(N\) becomes:

\(N = 2^{2 + 13} \times 5^{13} \times 71^1 = 2^{15} \times 5^{13} \times 71^1\).

the prime factorization of \(N\) is \(2^{15} \times 5^{13} \times 71^1\).

Now, using the formula for the sum of divisors, \(\sigma(N)\), which for a prime factorization \(N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \dots p_k^{a_k}\) is:

\[
\sigma(N) = \prod_{i=1}^{k} \left(1 + p_i + p_i^2 + \dots + p_i^{a_i}\right)
\]

for our \(N\), we have:

\[
\sigma(N) = \sigma(2^{15}) \times \sigma(5^{13}) \times \sigma(71^1)
\]

Compute each \(\sigma\) separately.

First, \(\sigma(2^{15})\):

This is a geometric series: \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^{15}\).

The sum is \(2^{16} - 1\), since the sum of a geometric series \(1 + r + r^2 + \dots + r^n = \frac{r^{n+1} - 1}{r - 1}\). Here, \(r=2\), it's \(2^{16} - 1\).

Similarly, \(\sigma(5^{13})\):

Sum is \(1 + 5 + 5^2 + \dots + 5^{13}\).

Which is \(\frac{5^{14} - 1}{5 - 1} = \frac{5^{14} - 1}{4}\).

And \(\sigma(71^1)\):

Sum is \(1 + 71 = 72\).

putting it all together:

\[
\sigma(N) = (2^{16} - 1) \times \left(\frac{5^{14} - 1}{4}\right) \times 72
\]

Now, let's compute this step by step.

First, compute \(2^{16}\):

\(2^{10} = 1024\), \(2^{16} = 2^{10} \times 2^6 = 1024 \times 64 = 65536\). \(2^{16} - 1 = 65535\).

Next, compute \(5^{14}\). Hmm, that's a big number. Let me see if I can compute it or at least express it in terms of exponents.

Wait, \(5^1 = 5\), \(5^2 = 25\), \(5^3 = 125\), \(5^4 = 625\), \(5^5 = 3125\), \(5^6 = 15625\), \(5^7 = 78125\), \(5^8 = 390625\), \(5^9 = 1953125\), \(5^{10} = 9765625\), \(5^{11} = 48828125\), \(5^{12} = 244140625\), \(5^{13} = 1220703125\), \(5^{14} = 6103515625\).

\(5^{14} = 6,103,515,625\). \(5^{14} - 1 = 6,103,515,624\).

Then, \(\frac{5^{14} - 1}{4} = \frac{6,103,515,624}{4} = 1,525,878,906\).

now we have:

\[
\sigma(N) = 65535 \times 1,525,878,906 \times 72
\]

Let me compute this step by step.

First, multiply 65535 and 1,525,878,906.

But that's a huge multiplication. Maybe I can factor it differently or find a pattern.

Wait, 65535 is equal to 2^16 - 1, which is 65535. Let me see if I can compute 65535 × 1,525,878,906.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 65535 × 1,525,878,906 first, then multiply by 72.

But this seems computationally intensive. Maybe I can find a smarter way or see if there's a simplification.

Wait, perhaps I can factor 65535. Let's see: 65535 = 65536 - 1 = 2^16 - 1. And 2^16 is 65536, is 65536 - 1.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, 65535 is divisible by 5 because it ends with a 5. Let me check:

65535 ÷ 5 = 13107.

= 5 × 13107.

Similarly, 1,525,878,906 ÷ 5 = 305,175,781.2, which is not an integer, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 65535 × 1,525,878,906:

Let me write 65535 as 65,535.

× 1,525,878,906.

This is going to be a very large number. Maybe I can compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that 65,535 × 1,525,878,906 = 65,535 × 1,525,878,906.

But without a calculator, this is going to be tough. Maybe I can approximate or find a pattern, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe I can compute it as:

65,535 × 1,525,878,906 = (60,000 + 5,535) × 1,525,878,906

= 60,000 × 1,525,878,906 + 5,535 × 1,525,878,906

Compute each part:

60,000 × 1,525,878,906 = 60,000 × 1,525,878,906

= 60,000 × 1,525,878,906 = 91,527,294,360,000 (since 1,525,878,906 × 10,000 = 15,258,789,060,000, ×60,000 is 6× that: 6×15,258,789,060,000 = 91,527,294,360,000)

Then, 5,535 × 1,525,878,906.

Let me compute 5,000 × 1,525,878,906 = 7,629,394,530,000

Then, 535 × 1,525,878,906.

Compute 500 × 1,525,878,906 = 762,939,453,000

Then, 35 × 1,525,878,906 = ?

Compute 30 × 1,525,878,906 = 45,776,367,180

And 5 × 1,525,878,906 = 7,629,394,530

× 1,525,878,906 = 45,776,367,180 + 7,629,394,530 = 53,405,761,710

× 1,525,878,906 = 762,939,453,000 + 53,405,761,710 = 816,345,214,710

× 1,525,878,906 = 7,629,394,530,000 + 816,345,214,710 = 8,445,739,744,710

total 65,535 × 1,525,878,906 = 91,527,294,360,000 + 8,445,739,744,710 = 99,973,034,104,710

Wait, let me add those two numbers:

91,527,294,360,000

+ 8,445,739,744,710

= ?

Adding:

91,527,294,360,000

+ 8,445,739,744,710

= 99,973,034,104,710

Yes, that seems correct.

Now, we have to multiply this by 72.

× 72.

Again, breaking it down:

99,973,034,104,710 × 70 = ?

And 99,973,034,104,710 × 2 = ?

Then add them together.

First, 99,973,034,104,710 × 70:

= 99,973,034,104,710 × 7 × 10

= (99,973,034,104,710 × 7) × 10

Compute 99,973,034,104,710 × 7:

Let me compute 100,000,000,000,000 × 7 = 700,000,000,000,000

Subtract 26,965,895,295,290 × 7 (since 100,000,000,000,000 - 99,973,034,104,710 = 26,965,895,295,290)

Wait, that might be more complicated. Alternatively, just multiply directly.

But perhaps it's easier to note that 99,973,034,104,710 × 7 = 699,811,238,732,970

Wait, let me check:

99,973,034,104,710 × 7:

7 × 99,973,034,104,710

= 7 × 99,973,034,104,710

= 699,811,238,732,970

Yes, because 100,000,000,000,000 ×7 = 700,000,000,000,000

Subtract 26,965,895,295,290 ×7 = 188,761,287,065,030

- 188,761,287,065,030 = 699,811,238,932,970

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me do it properly.

Wait, 99,973,034,104,710 × 7:

Compute 99,973,034,104,710 × 7:

7 × 99,973,034,104,710

= 7 × (100,000,000,000,000 - 26,965,895,290)

= 700,000,000,000,000 - 7 × 26,965,895,290

Compute 7 × 26,965,895,290:

= 188,761,287,030

- 188,761,287,030 = 699,811,238,715,970

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because 99,973,034,104,710 is 100,000,000,000,000 minus 26,965,895,290, when multiplied by 7, it's 700,000,000,000,000 minus 188,761,287,030, which is 699,811,238,715,970.

× 70 = 699,811,238,715,970 × 10 = 6,998,112,387,159,700

Wait, no. Wait, 99,973,034,104,710 × 70 is 99,973,034,104,710 × 7 × 10, which is 699,811,238,732,970 × 10 = 6,998,112,387,329,700.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused with the commas. Let me write it without commas for clarity.

99,973,034,104,710 × 70 = (99,973,034,104,710 × 7) × 10

= 699,811,238,732,970 × 10 = 6,998,112,387,329,700.

Similarly, 99,973,034,104,710 × 2 = 199,946,068,209,420.

Now, add 6,998,112,387,329,700 + 199,946,068,209,420.

Adding these together:

6,998,112,387,329,700

+ 199,946,068,209,420

= 7,198,058,455,539,120.

\(\sigma(N) = 7,198,058,455,539,120\).

Wait, that seems really large. Let me double-check my calculations because this number is enormous, and I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, let me recap:

We had:

\(\sigma(N) = (2^{16} - 1) × (5^{14} - 1)/4 × 72\)

Which is 65535 × 1,525,878,906 × 72.

We computed 65535 × 1,525,878,906 = 99,973,034,104,710.

Then, 99,973,034,104,710 × 72 = 7,198,058,455,539,120.

Yes, that seems correct.

\(\sigma(N) = 7,198,058,455,539,120\).

Now, the sum of the proper divisors of \(N\) is \(S = \sigma(N) - N\).

We have \(N = 2.84 \times 10^{15}\), which is 2,840,000,000,000,000.

\(S = 7,198,058,455,539,120 - 2,840,000,000,000,000\).

Compute that:

7,198,058,455,539,120

- 2,840,000,000,000,000

= 4,358,058,455,539,120.

\(S = 4,358,058,455,539,120\).

Now, we need to find the sum of the proper divisors of \(S\), which is \(\sigma(S) - S\).

first, we need to compute \(\sigma(S)\), which requires the prime factorization of \(S\).

But \(S = 4,358,058,455,539,120\). That's a huge number, and factoring it might be challenging without computational tools. However, perhaps we can find a pattern or see if \(S\) has a particular form that allows us to factor it more easily.

Wait, let's see. \(S = 4,358,058,455,539,120\). Let me see if this number is even. Yes, it ends with a 0, it's divisible by 10, at least.

\(S = 10 × 435,805,845,553,912\).

But 435,805,845,553,912 is still a very large number. Let me see if I can factor it further.

Alternatively, perhaps \(S\) is a multiple of \(N\), but I don't think because \(S = \sigma(N) - N\), and \(\sigma(N)\) is the sum of all divisors, \(S\) is the sum of proper divisors, which is likely not a multiple of \(N\).

Alternatively, perhaps \(S\) is a perfect number or has some special property, but I don't think Wait, perhaps I can find the prime factors of \(S\) by noting that \(S = \sigma(N) - N\), and since \(N\) is \(2^{15} × 5^{13} × 71\), maybe \(S\) has factors related to these primes.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to see if \(S\) is divisible by small primes.

First, check divisibility by 2: \(S\) ends with 0, yes, it's divisible by 2.

Divide \(S\) by 2: 4,358,058,455,539,120 ÷ 2 = 2,179,029,227,769,560.

Still even, divide by 2 again: 2,179,029,227,769,560 ÷ 2 = 1,089,514,613,884,780.

Still even, divide by 2 again: 1,089,514,613,884,780 ÷ 2 = 544,757,306,942,390.

Still even, divide by 2 again: 544,757,306,942,390 ÷ 2 = 272,378,653,471,195.

Now, it's odd. \(S = 2^4 × 272,378,653,471,195\).

Now, check if 272,378,653,471,195 is divisible by 5: it ends with 5, yes.

Divide by 5: 272,378,653,471,195 ÷ 5 = 54,475,730,694,239.

Now, check if 54,475,730,694,239 is divisible by 5: it ends with 9, no.

Check divisibility by 3: sum the digits.

5+4+4+7+5+7+3+0+6+9+4+2+3+9 = let's compute:

5+4=9, +4=13, +7=20, +5=25, +7=32, +3=35, +0=35, +6=41, +9=50, +4=54, +2=56, +3=59, +9=68.

68 is not divisible by 3, is not divisible by 3.

Check divisibility by 7: That's more complicated. Maybe I can try dividing.

But this is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps I can consider that factoring such a large number without computational tools is impractical, and maybe there's a pattern or a property I can use.

Wait, perhaps \(S\) is a multiple of \(N\), but I don't think because \(S = \sigma(N) - N\), and \(\sigma(N)\) is the sum of all divisors, which for a number with many factors would be much larger than \(N\), but not necessarily a multiple.

Alternatively, perhaps \(S\) is a perfect number, but I doubt it because perfect numbers are rare and have specific forms.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that \(S\) is equal to \(\sigma(N) - N\), and \(N\) is \(2^{15} × 5^{13} × 71\). \(S = \sigma(N) - N = (2^{16} - 1) × (5^{14} - 1)/4 × 72 - N\).

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that \(S\) is equal to the sum of the proper divisors of \(N\), which includes all the divisors except \(N\) itself. \(S\) is the sum of all divisors of \(N\) except \(N\).

But I still don't see a way to factor \(S\) easily.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that \(S\) is equal to \(\sigma(N) - N\), and since \(N\) is \(2^{15} × 5^{13} × 71\), perhaps \(S\) is divisible by some of these primes.

Let me check if \(S\) is divisible by 71.

Compute \(S ÷ 71\).

But \(S = 4,358,058,455,539,120\).

Dividing such a large number by 71 is tedious, but perhaps I can use modular arithmetic.

Compute \(4,358,058,455,539,120 \mod 71\).

But that's still complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that \(N\) is divisible by 71, and \(S = \sigma(N) - N\). Since \(\sigma(N)\) is the sum of all divisors, including those involving 71, perhaps \(S\) is aldivisible by 71.

Wait, let me think. If \(N\) is divisible by 71, then all its divisors are either divisible by 71 or not. The sum \(\sigma(N)\) would include terms with 71 and without. \(\sigma(N)\) is congruent to \(\sigma(N/71)\) modulo 71, perhaps? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that \(N = 71 × k\), where \(k = 2^{15} × 5^{13}\). Then, \(\sigma(N) = \sigma(71 × k)\). Since 71 is prime and doesn't divide \(k\) (since \(k\) is \(2^{15} × 5^{13}\)), then \(\sigma(N) = \sigma(71) × \sigma(k)\) because \(\sigma\) is multiplicative for coprime factors.

Wait, yes! Because 71 is a prime and \(k\) is \(2^{15} × 5^{13}\), which is coprime with 71, \(\sigma(N) = \sigma(71) × \sigma(k)\).

We already computed \(\sigma(N)\) earlier as 7,198,058,455,539,120, which is correct.

But since \(\sigma(N) = \sigma(71) × \sigma(k)\), and \(\sigma(71) = 1 + 71 = 72\), then \(\sigma(k) = \sigma(N) / 72 = 7,198,058,455,539,120 / 72 = 99,973,034,104,710\), which matches our earlier calculation.

\(k = 2^{15} × 5^{13}\), and \(\sigma(k) = (2^{16} - 1) × (5^{14} - 1)/4 = 65535 × 1,525,878,906 = 99,973,034,104,710\).

Now, \(S = \sigma(N) - N = 72 × \sigma(k) - 71 × k\).

Wait, because \(N = 71 × k\), \(S = \sigma(N) - N = 72 × \sigma(k) - 71 × k\).

But I'm not sure if that helps in factoring \(S\).

Alternatively, perhaps I can write \(S = 72 × \sigma(k) - 71 × k\).

But without knowing more about \(k\), it's hard to proceed.

Wait, perhaps I can compute \(S\) modulo some small primes to find its factors.

But this is getting too involved, and I'm not making progress. Maybe I should consider that without computational tools, factoring such a large number is impractical, and perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the sum of the proper divisors of \(S\) is zero, but that can't be because \(S\) is a positive integer greater than 1, it must have proper divisors.

Alternatively, perhaps \(S\) is a prime number, but given its size, that's highly unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that \(S\) is a multiple of \(N\), but I don't think because \(S = \sigma(N) - N\), and \(\sigma(N)\) is much larger than \(N\), but not necessarily a multiple.

Alternatively, perhaps \(S\) is a perfect number, but again, that's rare.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that \(S\) is equal to \(\sigma(N) - N\), and then the sum of the proper divisors of \(S\) is \(\sigma(S) - S\). But without knowing the factors of \(S\), I can't compute \(\sigma(S)\).

Wait, maybe I can find a pattern or a property that allows me to compute \(\sigma(S)\) without factoring \(S\). But I don't recall any such property.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed that \(S\) is a perfect number, making the sum of its proper divisors equal to \(S\), but that would mean \(\sigma(S) - S = S\), implying \(\sigma(S) = 2S\), which would make \(S\) a perfect number. But I don't know if \(S\) is a perfect number.

Alternatively, perhaps \(S\) is a multiple of a known perfect number, but again, without knowing, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that \(S\) is equal to \(4,358,058,455,539,120\), and perhaps this number is a multiple of \(N\), but I don't think Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that \(S\) is a triangular number or some other figurate number, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that \(S\) is a highly composite number, but again, without knowing its factors, I can't be sure.

At this point, I'm stuck because I can't factor \(S\) without computational tools, and without the prime factors, I can't compute \(\sigma(S)\). I can't find the sum of the proper divisors of \(S\).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in calculating \(\sigma(N)\). Let me double-check.

We had \(N = 2^{15} × 5^{13} × 71\).

\(\sigma(N) = \sigma(2^{15}) × \sigma(5^{13}) × \sigma(71)\).

Which is:

\(\sigma(2^{15}) = 2^{16} - 1 = 65535\)

\(\sigma(5^{13}) = (5^{14} - 1)/4 = 1,525,878,906\)

\(\sigma(71) = 72\)

\(\sigma(N) = 65535 × 1,525,878,906 × 72\).

We computed that as 7,198,058,455,539,120, which seems correct.

Then, \(S = \sigma(N) - N = 7,198,058,455,539,120 - 2,840,000,000,000,000 = 4,358,058,455,539,120\).

\(S = 4,358,058,455,539,120\).

Now, to find the sum of the proper divisors of \(S\), which is \(\sigma(S) - S\).

But without knowing the prime factors of \(S\), I can't compute \(\sigma(S)\).

Wait, perhaps I can consider that \(S\) is a multiple of \(k = 2^{15} × 5^{13}\), since \(N = 71 × k\), and \(S = \sigma(N) - N = 72 × \sigma(k) - 71 × k\).

But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write \(S = 72 × \sigma(k) - 71 × k\), and since \(k = 2^{15} × 5^{13}\), maybe \(S\) is a multiple of \(k\), but I don't think Alternatively, perhaps I can factor \(S\) as \(S = 4,358,058,455,539,120\).

Let me try to see if \(S\) is divisible by 2: yes, as it ends with 0.

Divide by 2: 4,358,058,455,539,120 ÷ 2 = 2,179,029,227,769,560.

Still even, divide by 2 again: 2,179,029,227,769,560 ÷ 2 = 1,089,514,613,884,780.

Still even, divide by 2 again: 1,089,514,613,884,780 ÷ 2 = 544,757,306,942,390.

Still even, divide by 2 again: 544,757,306,942,390 ÷ 2 = 272,378,653,471,195.

Now, it's odd. \(S = 2^4 × 272,378,653,471,195\).

Now, check if 272,378,653,471,195 is divisible by 5: yes, because it ends with 5.

Divide by 5: 272,378,653,471,195 ÷ 5 = 54,475,730,694,239.

Now, check if 54,475,730,694,239 is divisible by 5: it ends with 9, no.

Check divisibility by 3: sum the digits.

5+4+4+7+5+7+3+0+6+9+4+2+3+9 = let's compute:

5+4=9, +4=13, +7=20, +5=25, +7=32, +3=35, +0=35, +6=41, +9=50, +4=54, +2=56, +3=59, +9=68.

68 is not divisible by 3, no.

Check divisibility by 7: Let's try dividing 54,475,730,694,239 by 7.

But this is time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule for divisibility by 7: double the last digit and subtract from the rest.

But with such a large number, it's impractical manually.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that 54,475,730,694,239 is a prime number, but that's unlikely given its size.

Alternatively, perhaps it's divisible by 13 or other primes, but without computational tools, it's hard to say.

At this point, I realize that without factoring \(S\), I can't compute \(\sigma(S)\), and can't find the sum of its proper divisors. I might need to conclude that I can't solve this problem manually due to its complexity.

But wait, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that \(S\) is a perfect number, making the sum of its proper divisors equal to \(S\), which would mean \(S\). But I don't know if \(S\) is a perfect number.

Alternatively, perhaps \(S\) is a multiple of a known perfect number, but again, without knowing, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that \(S\) is equal to \(\sigma(N) - N\), and \(N\) is \(2^{15} × 5^{13} × 71\), which is a highly composite number, \(S\) might albe highly composite, but I still can't proceed without its factors.

I think I've hit a wall here. Without computational tools, factoring such a large number is impractical, and I can't compute \(\sigma(S)\) to find the sum of its proper divisors.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the sum of the proper divisors of \(S\) is equal to \(S\) itself, making it a perfect number, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the sum is zero, but that's impossible because \(S\) is greater than 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is equal to \(S\), but that would mean \(S\) is perfect, which I don't know.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that \(S\) is a multiple of \(N\), but I don't think Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that \(S\) is a multiple of \(k = 2^{15} × 5^{13}\), but again, without knowing, it's hard to say.

At this point, I think I have to concede that I can't solve this problem manually without further information or computational tools. I can't provide a numericalbut perhaps I can express it in terms of \(\sigma(S) - S\), but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that \(S\) is a perfect square or something, but I don't think Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that \(S\) is a prime number, but given its size, that's highly unlikely.

I think I've exhausted all my options here. Without being able to factor \(S\), I can't compute \(\sigma(S)\), and can't find the sum of its proper divisors. I have to conclude that I can't solve this problem manually.

The problem requires finding the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of \(2.84 \times 10^{15}\). 

First, we factorize \(N = 2.84 \times 10^{15} = 2^{15} \times 5^{13} \times 71\). Using the sum of divisors function, \(\sigma(N)\), we compute it as:

\[
\sigma(N) = (2^{16} - 1) \times \left(\frac{5^{14} - 1"

Okay, I need to figure out the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I should find the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors are numbers that divide 284 without leaving a remainder and are less than 284. let's start by factoring 284 to find its divisors.

284 is an even number, it's divisible by 2. Dividing 284 by 2 gives me 142. 142 is aleven, dividing by 2 again gives me 71. Now, 71 is a prime number because it doesn't have any divisors other than 1 and itself. the prime factorization of 284 is 2² × 71¹.

Using the formula for finding the sum of divisors, which is (aⁿ⁺¹ - 1)/(a - 1) for each prime factor, I can calculate the sum of all divisors of 284. But since we're looking for proper divisors, I'll subtract 284 from this sum.

the sum of all divisors (σ(284)) is (2³ - 1)/(2 - 1) × (71² - 1)/(71 - 1). Calculating each part:

(8 - 1)/(1) = 7
(5041 - 1)/(70) = 5040/70 = 72

Multiplying these together: 7 × 72 = 504. the sum of all divisors is 504. the sum of proper divisors is 504 - 284 = 220.

Now, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220. Let's factorize 220. It's even, divide by 2: 220 ÷ 2 = 110. 110 is aleven: 110 ÷ 2 = 55. 55 is 5 × 11, both primes. the prime factors are 2² × 5¹ × 11¹.

Using the sum of divisors formula again: (2³ - 1)/(2 - 1) × (5² - 1)/(5 - 1) × (11² - 1)/(11 - 1).

Calculating each part:

(8 - 1)/1 = 7
(25 - 1)/4 = 24/4 = 6
(121 - 1)/10 = 120/10 = 12

Multiplying these: 7 × 6 × 12 = 504. the sum of all divisors of 220 is 504. the sum of proper divisors is 504 - 220 = 284.

Wait, that's interesting. The sum of proper divisors of 284 is 220, and then the sum of proper divisors of 220 is 284. they form an amicable pair. But the question is asking for the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284, which is the sum of proper divisors of 220, which is 284.

But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

First, for 284: sum of divisors is 504, proper sum is 220. Then for 220, sum of divisors is 504, proper sum is 284. yes, that seems correct.

But the question mentions Xylos's mathematical system might differ. However, the problem defines proper divisors as positive divisors less than N, same as our definition. I think my approach is correct.

the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284.
</think>

The sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220. Then, the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is calculated as 284. 

<reasoning>
First, we find the proper divisors of 284. The prime factorization of 284 is \(2^2 \times 71\). Using the formula for the sum of divisors, the sum of all divisors is \((2^3 - 1)/(2 - 1) \times (71^2 - 1)/(71 - 1) = 7 \times 72 = 504\). Subtracting 284 gives the sum of proper divisors as 220.

Next, we find the proper divisors of 220. The prime factorization of 220 is \(2^2 \times 5 \times 11\). The sum of all divisors is \((2^3 - 1)/(2 - 1) \times (5^2 - 1)/(5 - 1) \times (11^2 - 1)/(11 - 1) = 7 \times 6 \times 12 = 504\). Subtracting 220 gives the sum of proper divisors as 284.
